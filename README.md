# Procedural Generation Game

## Overview
This project is a personal exploration of procedural content generation, inspired by the *Dungeoneering* skill from RuneScape. The goal was to learn about procedural generation techniques and improve my game development skills by creating a unique, randomized gameplay experience.

## Key Features
- **Randomized Levels**: Each playthrough features dynamically generated levels for endless variety.  
- **Adaptive Gameplay**: Enemies, treasures, and challenges are placed dynamically for a unique experience.  
- **Learning-Focused**: Built as a hands-on way to explore procedural algorithms and their applications in games.

## What I Learned
- Implementing procedural generation techniques like dungeon generation and random object placement.  
- Designing flexible game mechanics to adapt to procedurally generated environments.  
- Strengthening skills in Unity and C# for game development.

## Status
The project is complete and has been shelved as a successful learning experiment. It served its purpose as a personal passion project to explore procedural generation.

## Repository
This repository contains:
- **Source Code**: The core implementation of the game mechanics and procedural generation systems.
- **Assets**: Basic assets used for testing and visualization.

## License
This project is for personal use and learning purposes. No license is provided, as the project is not intended for distribution.
